Pure/Global_Theory:
	val dest_thm_names: theory -> (Proofterm.thm_id * Thm_Name.T) list
		Get a list of theorem id * (theorem name * position) in theory
			Proofterm.thm_id: return id of theorem
			Thm_name.T: string * int, name and occurence of theorem (fact)

	val get_thm_name: theory -> Thm_Name.T * Position.T -> thm
		From theory (object) and theorem name with position, return theorem (object)
			Position.T: "Source positions starting from 1"


Pure/Thm:
	val full_prop_of: thm -> term
		Get the term representation of the theorem (object)
